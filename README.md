# UniE Share App

# Description:

UniE share which is an app used to target a recurrent difficulty many students have to face on a daily basis consists of the lack of educational resources available to them, generating an ongoing educational gap. Considering this reality, the UNIe-Share App arrives with the ultimate purpose of closing this educational gap and providing the necessary tools so that any student can maximise their potential. It gives students several opportunities to study from textbooks, notes, exercises and tests. What is also ideal is that students also have the option to post and help others.

The app has been done with much effort by all our team members, trying everyday to develop feasible and efficient solutions to improve study for students.
